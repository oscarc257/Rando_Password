# Rando_Password

This code is creating a password by combining random characters from the lists of letters, symbols, and numbers. It starts by creating an empty list called password_list. Then, it uses loops to add the specified number of random letters, symbols, and numbers to the password_list. After all the characters have been added, it shuffles the list to randomize the order. Finally, it combines all the characters from the password_list into a single string, creating the password, and prints it out.
